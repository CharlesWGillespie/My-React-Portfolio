                <p class='p-tag'>Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Charles Gillespie, and this is where I share my passion for coding and technology. Immersed in the ever-evolving world of programming, I am on an exhilarating journey of learning and personal growth. My goal? To become an adept Developer, consistently pushing boundaries and embracing innovation. Beyond the screen, you'll often find me practicing my skills on the golf course, even if it may not look pretty. Gaming is another place where I find joy, exploring virtual landscapes and wondering into immersive experiences. And of course, there's nothing quite like spending quality time with my incredible girlfriend, who provides unwavering support and encouragement. My dedication to learning stems from an insatiable curiosity and a desire to bring ideas to life through code. I thrive on challenges, viewing each one as an opportunity to refine my abilities and broaden my understanding. where every line of code written is a step toward new horizons. The adventure has only just begun! Join me on this exciting journey as I code my way to new heights. The adventure is just beginning!</p>

                <h2 className="aboutme-h1">Why Did I Choose Development?</h2>
                <p>I come from a background of hard labor. Up until April of 2023, you might have spotted me working on powerlines as an Apprentice Lineman. As I worked on the powerlines, I would dream of what it would be like to be a developer. I craved creating virtual applications and sharing my creativity with others. After an accident in the field exacerbated by my asthma, I realized that it was time to take the leap and learn how to code. That's when I enrolled in UConn's Full Stack coding bootcamp! Looking back, I believe it was the best decision I have ever made.</p>
